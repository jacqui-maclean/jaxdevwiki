I want a digital version of my notes

Currently I have the following categories

JS
React
Git
VSC

Some search functionality would be good, not sure how to implement this and want to crack on, so will put tags on the page for now and look at searches later

On the main page I will have 4 categories as outlined above - this will be easy to expand
Each category page will display alphabetic cards that refer to each page of notes.

I guess if these are stored in JSON objects as static data, then I can put the detail there and extract it out into the card components. I will put my preexisting notes as images, and then add any notes to the JSON manually - with an eye to finally adding a CMS function that will enable me to dynamically add notes to the JSON object.

Have made the beginning of the JS data and put it in assets/data
